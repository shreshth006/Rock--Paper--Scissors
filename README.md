A simple Rock-Paper-Scissors script I wrote out of boredom.
It features three game modes:

Endless: Keeps the game going until you explicitly choose to stop.
Best-of-N: The first to win more than half of N rounds wins the game.
Knockout: The first to reach a score of N wins the game.

Enjoy — or feel free to expand on it. Let’s revolutionize this simple game and turn it into something more!
